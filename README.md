Code is in file.

First problem has two parts. First runs by itself, second requires two integer numbers to be separately input.

Second problem requires a sentence input. For it to do anything, the sentence must contain the word "Python" in some manner.

Third problem requires a number input between 0 and 100.

Code was demonstrated in class, so no video.
